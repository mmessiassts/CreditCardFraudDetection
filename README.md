# CreditCardFraudDetection
This notebook serves as a demonstration of how to explore, analyze, and build predictive models for this dataset.

This dataset comprises credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023. 
It contains over 550,000 records, and the data has been anonymized to safeguard the cardholders' identities. 
The primary purpose of this dataset is to aid in the development of fraud detection algorithms and models to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

Key Features:
id: Unique identifier for each transaction
V1-V28: Anonymized features representing various transaction attributes (e.g., time, location, etc.)
Amount: The transaction amount
Class: Binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)

Potential Use Cases:
Credit Card Fraud Detection: Build machine learning models to detect and prevent credit card fraud by identifying suspicious transactions based on the provided features.
Merchant Category Analysis: Examine how different merchant categories are associated with fraud.
Transaction Type Analysis: Analyze whether certain types of transactions are more prone to fraud than others.
